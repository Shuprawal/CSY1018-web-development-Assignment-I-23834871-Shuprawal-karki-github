                <p class="fir1-">Hi, I am Shuprawal Karki. I have designed and developed this website
                    using two computer programming languages HTML and CSS. I am fimilar with these computer since 2020.
                It's a second time for me to design a website but this time the website is much
            more efficient and user friendly. <br></p>
            <p class="fir2-">It took about three weeks to complete this website. Desigining hamburger menu and making website responsive
                was the most difficult portion among all. I had to go through multiple websites and I had to watch multiple videos to
                learn to design hamburger menu. While designing contact page was easiest among all.
                I have tried my best to design this website. There are some of screenshots of the webpage while i was desigining: 
            </p>
        <!--inserting screenshots of the website-->
            <img class="ss4-" src="./ss4.png" alt="">
            <div class="clr1ss-">
                <img class="ss2-" src="./Ss2.png" alt="">
                <img class="ss3-" src="./Ss3.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <div class="cl3ss-">
                <p class="fir3-">The majority portion in the home page of the website is in dark theme.
                    As the dark theme is associated with power and strength. In navbar there is also picture of skull
                    and in baground there is picture of fox. Fox is also regarded as good luck and it symbolizes
                    resilience while skull sometimes symbolizes the negative energy but it also represents bravery.
                    I have designed small color changing animation in home page. While in portfolio page I have inserted the images
                    captured by my self. In contact page I seperated signup page and information of designer into two equal half.
                    For work experience i have divided page into work experience ,internship and skill.
                <br>  
                When designing process of website was completed I used the website called "The W3C markup validation service" to check the validity of the websites.
                    I checked the code of all webpages  in that website and found out some of my errors. The screenshots of the result are:
